    alt: Understanding the Concept Cloud Managed Data Center Services
---
Managing an organization's data can be costly and time-consuming, and there are so many security risks and vulnerabilities to consider while managing company data. Data is exposed to a wide range of risks, such as:

- Environmental factors such as earthquakes, floods, fire
- Infrastructure problems such as power failure, utility instability, or cooling system failure
- Hackers can even sit on networks undetected
- The cost of downtime can cost the company up hours of work time.

Maintaining security and data backup storage are top strategies for protecting data. Data security posture management ([DSPM](https://www.flowsecurity.com/what-is-dspm-a-comprehensive-overview/)) is a must for organizations. That's why companies turn to cloud managed data center servives to ensure IT systems, applications, and data are available 24/7/365.

Data centers are like the brain and the backbone of any company. They are created on physical facilities that companies utilize to manage and store apps and data to streamline the delivery of shared applications and services data on-site. Data centers are essentially used by large businesses to store data. They are privately owned, tightly monitored, and managed on-site premises that house traditional IT infrastructure for the sole benefit of one organization.

However, this traditional approach of on-premises physical data centers has dramatically evolved in recent years. It used to be the large companies luxury to only move data into a data center. Instead of physical data centers, virtualized data centers have created a new wave of the modern data revolution and digital transformation. This way, IT infrastructures run on remote data servers that are not located on the company in house physical premises.

Cloud service providers are at the center of hosting virtualized Computing infrastructure for the shared use of varying organizations and customers. This offsets the operational cost, and companies from large, medium, to small, can own a piece of cloud manage data center services with benefits such as comprehensive security, scalability, and reduced downtime.

### What are cloud-based data centers

A cloud-based data center uses cloud computing technologies to access computing resources, storage, and networking on demand. It is a data center hosted by cloud service providers. Using cloud-based data centers, a cloud service provider allows access to services such as

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

The growth of cloud-based data centers is an overall outcome of demands to reduce IT costs while maximizing value to the company. Cloud providers create managed data centers. This we can leverage outsourcing of managed services to run infrastructure technology applications and support.

Business owners don't have to worry about upgrading servers and other cost-related maintenance to a data center. The managed data center responsibility is to maintain the hardware, network infrastructure, and services. They are fundamentally deployed, operated, and monitored by third-party data center service providers.

### Data center and a cloud

Based on what we have discussed, it is evident a data center on-premises facility that houses computer systems and associated components. All of the IT infrastructure needed by the business is maintained on-site.

A data center infrastructure has its main components that work together to provide computing power, storage, and networking capabilities. A data center has three primary components:

- **Computing resources** with server computing resources such as CPUs and RAM to run software and applications.
- **Networking infrastructure** created using routers, switches, and firewalls that connect the data center to the organization's network infrastructure. It additionally contains tools for protecting the data center from cybersecurity to the on-premise networks.
- **Storage infrastructure** storage technologies for data storage and data center backups.

A cloud provider of off-site remote on-demand computing resources and services over the internet and is accessible to multiple users and organizations. In this case, a company rents infrastructure from a third-party provider and uses the internet to access data center resources. The cloud service provider is accountable for maintaining, upgrading, and fulfilling service level agreements (SLAs) for the components of the infrastructure stack that are directly under its control.

### Cloud services and managed IT services

Cloud services range from on-demand computing services delivered by cloud service providers. With a cloud provider, we don't need to invest in expensive hardware and infrastructure. These cloud storage service providers ensure:

- Unlimited data storage capacity
- Easy data recovery
- Cost reduction as we only pay what we use based on on-demand access.
- Anywhere access with an internet connection.
- We can entrust a third party to handle proper security measures.

Managed IT services are outsourced IT services managed and delivered by a third-party service provider. These services include IT support, network and security management, data backup and recovery, and other tasks. These tasks include software installation, upgrade and patching, network management, and security monitoring. Managed service providers ensure:

- Optimized application scalability based on the service demand.
- 24/7 monitoring and maintenance of services and other system-level software.
- Increase productivity with workflow automation as the team focuses on other initiatives that achieve business expectations.
- Data storage and backup maintenance.
- Data availability at all times, anytime we need it.
- Fault-tolerant and data center infrastructure redundancy with application-reduced downtime.
- Cybersecurity and physical security pounce on any data threats.

### Data center as a service (DCaaS)

The data center as a service (DCaaS) is a cloud service that remotely provides access to virtual data centers. Leveraging data centers as a service allows us access to computing power without spending a fortune. Running a data center as a service model lets us benefit from having our own data center. The hosting provider creates a data center infrastructure and facilities for rent or lease provisioned to clients.

DCaaS provide unique needs and customizations based on companies' objectives while mitigating the limitations of on-premises infrastructure. This means we can supplement limited computer resources with the huge advantage of scaling up and down based on traffic. The added benefit of usage-based cost control spending with predictable pricing.

DCaaS champions data availability with built-in redundancies that ensure consistent uptime. Services supplied by DCaaS vendors are packaged with cutting-edge security. With such services, we can quickly deploy IT resources without investing in physical hardware.

### The four main types of data centers

- **Enterprise data centers** - owned and operated by individual organizations and optimized for their end users to support their own IT infrastructure.
- **Colocation data centers** - ("colo") are owned by data center providers that then rent out space off company premises.
- **Cloud data centers** - operated by cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) to cloud host computing services.
- **Managed services data centers** - a managed services provider handles data as a third party on the company's behalf.

### Conclusion

If we need to remain competitive, data centers must quickly evolve data computing ability with cut costs while increasing customer satisfaction benefits to technology transformation with security and data privacy. Cloud-based data centers create virtual environments for cloud computing. They are managed by third-party providers and can be accessed by multiple users from anywhere if we have an internet connection with the correct access privileges to the specific data. Adding DCaaS cloud service strengthens the overall access to virtual data centers.
