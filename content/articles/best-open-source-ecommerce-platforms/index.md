Online presence is now crucial if you want your business to stay competitive, and there are many options to consider in weighing the type of e-commerce solution for your organization, whether they be open-source, Software-as-Service (SaaS), or DIY e-commerce platforms. With an *open-source e-commerce software* solution, the business gets full access to the source code and can configure it to match their specific business requirements. The business owner is in charge of installing the system on their own server, configuring hosting, and managing all technologies, security, data, and the website's general operation. *SaaS* providers operate on a subscription basis and work to secure, maintain, and host a business’s e-commerce site on the provider’s own servers. For e-commerce business owners who don't want to spend time, energy, or resources on maintenance, SaaS systems are an excellent solution.

Finally, with *DIY e-commerce*, a company hires developers to create unique solutions to fit business objectives and processes. Businesses generally choose DIY e-commerce because their business model or operations necessitate complete control over their application, technology stack, and implementation.

This article will provide an open-source e-commerce software comparison. If you’re a developer considering making a change in your e-commerce platform of choice, this is a great place to start exploring what other options exist.
