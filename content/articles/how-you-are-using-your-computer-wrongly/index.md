You might be using your computer and doing things that unknowingly destroy your PC. Here are a few ways in which you might be doing and ruining your computer and how to improve the experience from your computer. They include:

### Shutting down your computer

You might be shutting down your computer by either clicking on the start menu and shutting down the PC or just pressing the start button. These may damage your PC as windows 10, when shut down from the start button, backs up your data to help a fast startup. The feature is enabled, and your PC will have more hibernation than a shutdown. While long pressing to shut down can cause file damage, the computer shuts down prematurely and doesnâ€™t have time to close the files that might be running in the background. To switch off your PC, you should first restart your computer to clear everything running in the background, or you can easily disable the fast startup settings. Check on how to disable startup [here](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/basic-computer-skills/disable-applications-from-running-on-startup/1/).

### Agreeing to terms and conditions without reading

Most of the time, we are in a hurry to install a program, and we tend to find ourselves just clicking on the box to agree to its terms and conditions without taking time to go through them. Sometimes the privacy policies may be compromised. To stop these from happening, you should take time to read the terms and conditions and only agree when contented.

### Reusing passwords

As you continue accumulating more accounts on different sites, you might reuse a password to remember while logging in easily. If a hacker or anyone with ill intentions gets that one password, they get access to all of your social media and bank accounts. To refrain from these, create strong passwords and use each password separately.

### Using outdated operating system.

Outdated operating systems may make you vulnerable to hackers as some of their antiviruses may not be able to detect the modern forms of viruses. Obsolete OS, for example, Windows 7 antivirus, may run out of security updates from the Microsoft team. If you might be using the old versions of the Windows operating system, upgrading is necessary just in case any vulnerability appears.

### Delaying security update

If you are using Windows 10 pro, then there is an option where you can delay Windows security updates. Delaying security updates makes you vulnerable. When there is a security issue, many hackers tend to use that loop and try to take advantage, making your computer vulnerable. It is recommended that you let your security update and feature updates be enabled to stop any computer attacks.
