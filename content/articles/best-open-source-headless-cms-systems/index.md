A Headless CMS is a back-end Content Management System (CMS) where the content repository (body) is separated from the head (front-end). Its focus is on managing and delivering the content to any channel.

A headless CMS provides the content through its API, which then delivers content to your website, your app, or your devices. It's a multichannel method for distributing dynamic content across multiple platforms and devices. Dive into this guide and learn the best open-source CMS systems in 2023 to add in you bucket list.

### 2023 Open-source CMS Overview

In determining which free headless CMS to use in 2032, here are some important factors to consider:

- Language support: A good headless CMS will include support for multiple languages.
- Flexibility: Your headless CMS should deliver content to other communication channels seamlessly.
- Data source integrations: Integrations are done with the help of APIs. A headless CMS generates and exposes CRUD as an API, allowing you to Add, Read, Update, or Delete data through the exposed API.
- Ease of implementation: The headless CMS should let you efficiently manage and deliver content to different platforms.
- API or code management based: APIs enable software to connect and communicate to allow content delivery. Data exposed through an API allows you to store and interact with that data. Code management is a technique of tracking code modifications for development projects. Developers and testers ensure they’re working with updated code and resolve conflicts while merging code from different sources.
