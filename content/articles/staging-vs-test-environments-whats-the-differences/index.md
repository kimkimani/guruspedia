The [software development lifecycle](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm) clearly defines the processes for creating a high-quality application. It defines a series of well-structured stages to develop an application and create releases more frequently. These stages include how you plan your application, its analysis, design and development of the actual application, testing, [deployment](https://guruspedia.com/confidently-automate-aws-eks-cluster-deployments-with-terraform/) of your application to production, and maintenance you need to keep it up and running.

These stages are implemented in different software environments: development, testing, staging, and production. Creating and maintaining a reliable environment determine the application's quality to be released to live production environments. In this context, two commonly used pre-release environments are the staging and test environments.

This article will teach you the characteristics, purposes, and key differences associated with staging and testing environments while highlighting their unique roles in the application development lifecycle.

### What is a staging environment

Creating your software involves building and writing the code and the development stage. This code will be deployed for production. A staging environment serves as a bridge between development and production environments.

Staging simulates a production environment to validate the integration of your software component components.

#### Staging environment purpose

The major activity for a staging environment is to carry out comprehensive [user-acceptance testing (UAT)](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-carry-out-effective-user-acceptance-testing-uat/) and interface testing. Typically, this stage is used by developers and the quality assurance (QA) team to test how an application behaves. This lets the team test the applications as expected when it is deployed in a production environment.

In short, a team creates a replica of the main application and adds mock realistic data, configurations and changes according to the production requirement of that application.

These activities replicate those of what the actual user experiences on the live application. Staging carries out UAT to ensure the application runs without any critical or significant bugs that can harm the end users. This way, it is easier to identify any potential point of concern before the application is released to a live production environment.

#### Staging environment characteristics

The staging environment carries out pre-production activities. Thus, it has the same technologies, server configuration, database, and caching system as used in production. This stage is characterized by distinguishable activities such as:

- It uses realistic user scenarios replicating real activities.
- You will use external integrations of your application, such as APIs, test monitoring tools, databases, backups etc.
- It carries out privacy and security measures to protect the data within the staging environment from unauthorized access and breaches.
- Mimics the deployment procedures and configurations.
- Simulate the deployment process and assess it.

#### Staging environment benefits

- Provides validation in a near-production environment with accurate representation.
- It carries out UAT to check user preferences and improve user experience.
- QA checks that ensure the highest quality standards are being deployed to production.
- Creates a smooth release as everything is working as intended.
- It allows performance and load tastings for performance optimization

### What is a testing environment

The staging environment replicates the application real world. This is the opposite of testing the environment. A test environment is like a lab focusing on testing application components in an isolated and controlled environment.

In this strategy, the application is deployed and tested by a QA team or beta testers. However, with some differences between those of pre-production (staging) and production environments

#### Testing environment purpose

This stage checks application quality to identify and fix bugs before deployment to the staging or production environments. It uses multiple test cases with methodologies such as unit tests, functional testing and end-to-end testing to test any faulty code in individual parts of an application.

If a test fails, bugs are identified and fixed; if the test passes, the application moves to the next lifecycle.

To guarantee comprehensive feedback about the application quality, a dedicated testing environment is created, ensuring:

- You have clearly defined the goals and objectives of testing and what the testers should achieve.
- The types of testing must be identified in each test case, including unit, acceptance, integration, regression, performance, and security tests.
- Create a scope defining which application parts will be tested.
- Create the test case with comprehensive configurations such as servers and databases to simulate the production environment.
- Any new code changes are tested before being pushed to production

#### Testing environment characteristics

A testing environment is characterized by the following:

- It uses an isolated lab-like environment.
- Has multiple test techniques.
- It has controlled and predictable conditions for test results.
- Often uses synthetic designed test data.
- Tests focus on extensive debugging and troubleshooting activities

#### Testing environment key benefits

The main takeaways for a testing environment are:

- Easy and easy bug detection.
- You eliminate any bugs in your application.
- You get a comprehensive component validation.
- Quality assurance of your application is improved with feedback on quality assessment.
- These tests potently identify any areas of improvement and new ideas.

### Staging environment vs testing environment: what is the main difference

Now that you understand what staging environment and testing environment are, their characteristic, benefits, and do you need both, let's summarize the main differences:

| Staging Environment | Testing Environment |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Validate overall functionality and integration. | Used to identify and fix bugs|
| Mirrors production environment | Controlled and predictable|
| Realistic data and configurations| Predictable data for accurate testing scenarios |
| Use real user case| Synthetic test data |
| It is deployment simulated | Created testing environment configuration|
| Risk mitigation | Bug detection|  
| Validates application in near-production environment| Gets rid of bugs|

### Conclusion

Staging and testing environments can't be overlooked in any application lifecycle. You want high-quality code that behaves as expected by your application users. The methodology you choose for each stage largely depends on your application scope.
